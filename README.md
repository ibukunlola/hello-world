This repository is my first attempt at understanding and using GitHub

Ibukun is a rising Junior at Minerva Schools at KGI, studying data science and economics. Ibukun self-identifies as a highly sensitive person because of her incredibly heightened reactions to changes in her environment and sensory inputs. She is also highly intuitive and empathic making her presence quite comforting. Ibukun's goal for life is to become one of the most powerful people alive. 

She would like to use her power and influence to encourage disadvantaged women and eradicate gender and racial discrimination. Ibukun loves to hear about people's stories and tell her own stories too!
